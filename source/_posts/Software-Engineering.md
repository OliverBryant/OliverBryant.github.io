## Chapter 1

### 1. What is Software Engineering?

​	Software engineers use their knowledge of computers and computing to help solve problems.Software engineers use techniques, tools, procedures, and paradigms to enhance the quality of their software products. Their aim is to use efficient and productive approaches to generate effective solutions to problems. Instead of investigating hardware design or proving theorems about how algorithms work, a software engineer focuses on the computer as a problem-solving tools.



### 2. What is good software?

​	Good software engineering must always include a strategy for producing quality software. But before we can devise a strategy, we must understand what we mean by quality software.

1. The quality of the product.
2. The quality of the process.
3. Quality in the context of the business environment.



### 3. What are 9 activities in software development?

1. requirements analysis and definition
2. system design
3. program design
4. writing the programs (program implementation)
5. unit testing
6. integration testing
7. system testing
8. system delivery
9. maintenance



### 4. How has software engineering changed?

1. criticality of time-to-market for commercial products
2. shifts in economics of computing: lower HW, higher development/maintenance costs
3. availability of powerful desktop computing
4. extensive local- and wide-area networking
5. availability and adoption of OO technology
6. graphical user interfaces
7. unpredictability of waterfall model of development



### 5. What is the Wasserman's discipline of software engineering?

1. abstraction
2. analysis and design methods and notations
3. user interface prototyping
4. software architecture
5. software process
6. reuse
7. measurement
8. tools and integrated environments



## Chapter 2

### 1. What are the drawbacks of the Waterfall model?

1. The model provides no guidance to managers and developers on how to handle changes to products and activities that are likely to occur during development.
2. It does not treat software as a problem-solving process. It was derived from a manufacturing view of software development. Software is a creation process, not a manufacturing process. Creation usually involves trying a little of this or that, developing and evaluating prototypes, assessing the feasibility or requirements, contrasting several designs, learning from failure, and eventually setting on a satisfactory solution to the problem at hand.
3. The biggest problem with the waterfall model is that it does not reflect the way code is really developed.

### 2. What are the benefits of the Incremental Model and Iterative Model?

1. Training can begin on an early release, even if some functions are missing.
2. Markets can be created early for functionality that has never before been offered.
3. Frequent releases allow developers to fix unanticipated problems globally and quickly, as they are reported from the operational system.
4. The development team can focus on different areas of expertise with different releases.



## Chapter 4

### 1. Describe the process of determining requirements.

1. Elicitation: Collecting the user's requirements.
2. Analysis: Understanding and modeling the desired behavior.
3. Specification: Documenting the behavior of the proposed software system.
4. Validation: Checking that our specification matches the user's requirements.



### 2. It is usually helpful to separate the requirements into three categories. What are these three categories? Explain why it is helpful.

1. Three categories are:
   - Requirements that absolutely must be met.
   - Requirements that are highly desirable but not necessary.
   - Requirements that are possible but could be eliminated.
2. Reasons: The analysis of requirements by category is helpful to all parties in understanding what is really needed. It is also useful when a software development project is constrained by time or resources; if the system as defined will cost too much or take too long to develop, category 3 requirements can be dropped and category 2 requirements can be analyzed for elimination or postponement.



### 3. What is a requirements definition document? What is a requirements specification document?
